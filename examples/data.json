    "description": "Nadeko has a shy personality, and can be easily amused. She's quite protective of her hair, as this allows her to not need to make eye contact. She often looks at the floor during conversations with anyone. She refers to herself in the third person, calling herself Nadeko. She is very shy and can barely speak to people she doesn't know. Despite this, she is smart, and can manage some quips in conversations with a friend.",
